## Introduction   

There are two main objectives for this project:      
1. my knowledge of c++ is close to zero, so I want to improve my skills.     
2. build a deep learning framework myself with the knowledge I've acquired during my studies.      

In this context, this project is in no way intended to be optimized. It's just a way for me to improve my skills and make sure I understand my job.     

You can find the source code of the project here: [https://github.com/p-omahony/cpasgrad](https://github.com/p-omahony/cpasgrad).

## Problem formulation

Let's start by analyzing what we need to build a minimalist neural network framework:   
- an automatic differentiation engine     
- a tensor object and his operations    
- loss functions      
- optimization algorithms     
- neural network layers     
- metrics for evaluation
